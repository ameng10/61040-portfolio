## Domains and Problems

### 1. **Fashion Inspiration**
People spend hours trying to figure out what clothes to buy and it is hard to envision how a piece of clothing can fit on you. I have found online shopping very hard because I do not know how it is going to look on me and I cannot envision it. If there was a way to give me inspiration on an outfit and maybe a social media to vote on the fits then it could be cool.
- *Outfit Visualization*: Not knowing how an outfit would fit or look on me. This leads to wasted time and money and solving this would help users make more confident purchases.
    - Reason for not selection: The idea of using computer vision to visualize an outfit on top of a virtual avatar of a person is a very bold and difficult idea that I am not suited to create as of now. It is also hard to connect with brands and clothing stores to find specific measurements on every piece of clothing so that the app can visualize how it would look on a person. I am also not convinced people will trust the app as it can not guarantee that the user will 100% fit in the chosen clothes.
- *Outfit Inspiration*: Finding ideas for outfits or clothing combinations.
    - Reason for not selection: There are already many apps and social media platforms (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok) where outfit inspiration are prominent with sharing clothing combinations. The space is saturated and it would be hard to differentiate a new app.
- *Affordable Shopping*: Not knowing where to buy affordable versions of the outfits I like and finding affordable substitutes.
    - Reason for selection: While there are shopping apps, few focus specifically on helping users find affordable alternatives to specific outfits they see online. A tool that matches expensive looks to budget-friendly items is not widely available and could fill a unique gap. This could also incorporate a community feature that would spread ideas for clothing.

### 2. **Travel**
When I want to plan a trip to somewhere else, I spend a lot of time planning. And as a college student, I often do not know what attractions to go to, where places are, or even how I should be approaching the culture. My family goes on many vacations a year and my mom spends so much time creating an itinerary. I would love to have real recommendations for where to go to based on my interests and past trips.
- *Trip Budgeting*: Not knowing how to budget for a trip or find deals on flights/hotels.
    - Reason for not selection: There are already many travel budgeting and deal-finding apps (Kayak, Hopper, Expedia, Google Travel) that help users plan and budget trips. Although my idea is inputting a budget and outputting the top deals and best quality for your buck, it seems like Expedia and other travel apps already do a similar enough job of this, so shifting to a new app would not be influential.
- *Group Planning*: Trouble coordinating plans with friends or family and keeping everyone updated.
    - Reason for not selection: Group travel planning is addressed by apps like TripIt, Google Trips, and shared calendars. It also is not hard to share plans so the market is very small.
- *Day to Day Trip Adjustments*: Many days can be ruined due to weather without knowing any substitutes.
    - Reason for selection: Most itinerary and travel planning apps are static—they don’t adjust in real time when things go wrong. Weather apps might warn about rain, and Google Maps might show nearby attractions, but nothing combines these into context-aware, interest-based alternatives. A system that dynamically reshapes the day to save trips from being wasted is very important and trip changing.

### 3. **Food Tracker**
Food is a very large part of my life and I am very uneducated on which foods are healthy for me or how foods affect me. When I was in Amsterdam for the summer, I did not know which foods to cook or what specific flavor each ingredient added to the meal. I would like to have different ways to know learn how each food affects me and give me inspiration on new meals.
- *Nutrition Management and Analyzation*: Have ai analyzation for how foods affect me.
    - Reason for selection: While there are calorie trackers and nutrition apps, few provide personalized AI-driven analysis of how specific foods affect an individual’s health over time, especially with integration of personal health data. I can adjust this to help people with stomach issues or other health problems in which they need to track how different foods affect their health issues. This can be really impactful and many people can use this, for example we can track how certain foods affect bodybuilders and the best foods can be promoted.
- *Recipe Inspiration*: Social Media for recipes where people can upvote homemade recipes that work well.
    - Reason for not selection: Recipe sharing and voting is already well covered by platforms like Allrecipes, Tasty, and Reddit’s food communities. It is also not too hard to look up recipes online and many people use ChatGPT to look for recipes. Although the idea is good, it is just not a big enough problem for people to care about.
- *Grocery Shopping Assistant*: Suggests healthy groceries based on your preferences and budget, and helps you build a shopping list.
    - Reason for not selection: Grocery list and healthy shopping apps (Instacart, Yummly, Mealime) already exist and are widely used. There are already many applications that exist and there is very little room for innovation here.

### 4. **DJ Mixing**
I enjoy DJing but I find it hard to find out how to mix songs. If there was a way to generate recommended mixes based on my own preferences and bpm and keys then that would be good.

### 5. **Gym Workouts**
I hit the gym very often but I don't exactly know which exercises are the best. I think that an app that would help people figure out the best techniques for hitting the gym would be great.

### 6. **Roommate Finding**
A very hard part about moving somewhere new and affordable is finding a roommmate to live with, whether it be college or not, and I think that having a designated way to find roommate or new friends would be helpful.

### 7. **Studying Habits**
I am always inconsistent with my studying habits so I would like a way to test how my habits affect my actual test scores and my hapiness levels.

### 8. **Therapy/ Diary / Mental Health**
I often need to write my thoughts down but I do not like other people seeing my thoughts. I would rather have a place where I can get anaylsis of my thoughts from my own self.

### 9. **Athlete Tracker**
I often want to track how athletes do without wanting to see how well their teams are. I would like to have a way to just keep track of this one player.

### 10. **Track and Field Coaching**
Track and Field can be a very individual sport and most people I know began track and field through youtube videos. There are so many events and track and field is super trial and error based where you try different techniques to see what works. There is also a lot to remember when it comes to actually doing an event, so an app that can be a coach and see everything could be useful.

### Day-to-Day Trip Adjustments
- Weather is a major reason trips get disrupted. Surveys show that more than half of travelers have had their plans changed by bad weather, so there’s a clear need for apps that help people adapt. ([Aon](https://www.aon.com/travel_blog/blog_posts/navigating-the-storms-weather-risks-reshaping-how))

- Navigation apps like Drive Weather show road conditions, but don’t help with activity swaps. This means there’s still a need for tools that help travelers adjust their plans beyond just driving. ([Aon](https://www.aon.com/travel_blog/blog_posts/navigating-the-storms-weather-risks-reshaping-how))
- Business travelers also face frequent disruptions, with surveys showing that most have had their productivity affected by travel chaos. This highlights the value of adaptive planning tools. ([TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/business-travel-chaos-survey))

### Food Tracker Nutrition Management & Analysis
- People react differently to the same foods. Studies show that everyone’s body responds in unique ways to meals, so personalized diet advice can help people feel better and stay healthier. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26590418), [Cell](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674%2815%2901481-6))
- New research in 2025 links differences in blood sugar responses to genetics and gut bacteria, proving that personalized nutrition is important for health. ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03719-2))
- The PREDICT program, which powers the ZOE app, uses large studies to show how people’s bodies react to food. This evidence supports the idea of apps that track personal food effects. ([Zoe](https://zoe.com/our-studies?srsltid=AfmBOop5eX7LzTIl7B-brsQ2XDegDeYvKw_V7lUboiMkHjVNHDi9PvAD))
- Mobile health apps are starting to predict when people are vulnerable to blood sugar spikes and send timely advice. This shows that AI-driven nutrition insights are possible and useful. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271334))
- Reviews of nutrition apps argue that machine learning and personalization can help people more than generic diet advice. This means smarter, individualized tools are needed. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12350580))
- Gut sensitivity and IBS are common worldwide. Studies show that many people need to track how foods affect their symptoms, so there’s a large potential user base for personalized food tracking. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354571), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.922063/full), [JNM Journal](https://www.jnmjournal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5056%2Fjnm22037))
- Standard calorie tracking apps often have accuracy problems and people stop using them over time. Studies show that smarter, more engaging tools are needed to keep users motivated. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4422872))
- Counting calories can be misleading. Dietitians and health articles say that absorption varies and apps can sometimes encourage unhealthy eating habits, so it’s better to focus on how foods actually affect you. ([SELF](https://www.self.com/story/counting-calories-not-necessary-weight-loss), [EatingWell](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8065441/problem-with-calorie-tracking-apps-dietitian-instagram))
- MyFitnessPal is a popular app for tracking calories and macros, but studies question its accuracy for some people. There’s a gap for apps that track the real effects of foods over time. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11221275))
- Cronometer is good for tracking micronutrients, but it relies on users to log everything and doesn’t analyze how foods affect symptoms or health. A new app could close this gap. ([Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/index.html), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cronometer/comments/1jakfe7/how_accurate_do_you_find_the_apps_micronutrient))
